            A lolcat is an image macro of one or more cats. The image's text is
            often idiosyncratic and grammatically incorrect, and is known as
            lolspeak.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lolcat is a composite of two words, "lol" and "cat". "Lol" stands
            for "Laugh out Loud" or "Laughing out Loud"; hence, lolcats are
            intended to be funny and to include jokes. Lolcats images comprise a
            photo of a cat with a large caption characteristically set in a
            heavy sans serif font such as Impact or Arial Black. The image is,
            on occasion, digitally edited for effect.
          </p>

          <p>
            The caption generally acts as a speech balloon encompassing a
            comment from the cat, or as a description of the depicted scene. The
            caption is intentionally written with deviations from standard
            English spelling and grammar, featuring "strangely-conjugated verbs,
            but a tendency to converge to a new set of rules in spelling and
            grammar". The text parodies the grammar-poor patois stereotypically
            attributed to Internet slang. Frequently, lolcat captions take the
            form of phrasal templates. Some phrases have a known source, usually
            a well-known Internet meme, such as All your base are belong to us
            or Do not want, while others don't. The language of lolcats has also
            been likened to baby talk, however it draws on a variety of
            linguistic resources, not just the imitation of baby talk.

              Common themes include jokes of the form "Im in ur [noun],
              [verb]-ing ur [related noun]." Many lolcat images capture cats
              performing characteristically human actions or appearing to use
              modern technology, such as computers.

              There are several well-known lolcat images and single-word
              captions that have spawned many variations and imitations,
              including "Ceiling Cat". Others include Fail (a cat with a slice
              of processed cheese on its face) and "I Can Has Cheezburger" (a
              portrait of a blue British Shorthair). Another popular format is
              "[Adjective] cat is [adjective/noun]."
